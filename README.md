## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

- To showcase **practical projects**, not just theory
- To maintain a **structured portfolio** across domains
- To demonstrate problem-solving, implementation, and continuous learning
- To provide easy navigation for recruiters, collaborators, and peers

Each project is organized by domain and contains its own documentation, code, and results.
